This is an DTH for Fibaro Wall Plug Z-Wave+ version 3.2

This DTH provides the following functionality:

* On/Off
* Power and Energy Monitoring
* Manual refresh both Power and Energy (by tapping one of the value tiles)
* Reset for accumulated kWh value
* Configuration for 12 parameters:
  * Always on function
  * Restore state after power failure
  * Overload safety switch
  * Immediate power reports
  * Standard power reports
  * Power reporting interval
  * Energy reports
  * Periodic power and energy report
  * Energy consumed by the device itself
  * Power load which makes the LED ring flash violet
  * Ring LED color when on
  * Ring LED color when off
* Parameter synchronization status information on main tile
* Summary power and energy information on main tile

This DTH was briefly tested by me for issues like lockup after fast switching and failure to respond without connected load and does not seem to have this issues but I don't guarantee it's is completely free of them.
